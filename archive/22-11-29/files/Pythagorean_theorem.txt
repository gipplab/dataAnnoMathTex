{{General geometry |concepts}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''Pythagorean theorem''', or '''Pythagoras's theorem''', is a fundamental relation in [[Euclidean geometry]] among the three sides of a [[right triangle]]. It states that the area of the square whose side is the [[hypotenuse]] (the side opposite the [[right angle]]) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the [[Cathetus|other two sides]]. This [[theorem]] can be written as an [[equation]] relating the lengths of the sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', often called the '''Pythagorean equation''':<ref name="Sally0">{{cite book |title=Roots to research: a vertical development of mathematical problems |author1=Judith D. Sally |author2=Paul Sally |page=63 |chapter=Chapter 3: Pythagorean triples |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHxBw-WlECUC&pg=PA63 |isbn=978-0-8218-4403-8 |year=2007 |publisher=American Mathematical Society Bookstore}}</ref>
:<math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ,</math>
where ''c'' represents the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the triangle's other two sides.  The theorem, whose history is the subject of much debate, is named for the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thinker [[Pythagoras]], born around 570 BC.

The theorem has been proven numerous times by many different methods—possibly the most for any mathematical theorem. The proofs are diverse, including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs, with some dating back thousands of years. 

The theorem can be [[Generalization|generalized]] in various ways: to higher-dimensional spaces, to spaces that are not Euclidean, to objects that are not right triangles, and to objects that are not triangles at all but ''n''-dimensional solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness, mystique, or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps, and cartoons abound.

==Rearrangement proof==
[[File:Pythagoras-proof-anim.svg|thumb|The rearrangement proof (click to view animation)]]The two large squares shown in the figure each contain four identical triangles, and the only difference between the two large squares is that the triangles are arranged differently. Therefore, the white space within each of the two large squares must have equal area. Equating the area of the white space yields the Pythagorean theorem, [[Q.E.D.]]<ref>Benson, Donald. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8_vbuzxrpfIC&pg=PA172 The Moment of Proof : Mathematical Epiphanies]'', pp. 172–173 (Oxford University Press, 1999).</ref>

Heath gives this proof in his commentary on Proposition I.47 in Euclid's ''Elements'', and mentions the proposals of Bretschneider and Hankel that Pythagoras may have known this proof.  Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion "that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him."<ref>{{harvtxt|Euclid|1956}}, pp. 351–352</ref>  Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Huffman | first=Carl | title=Pythagoras | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2018 Edition) | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N. Zalta | url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/pythagoras/}}, "It should now be clear that decisions about sources are crucial in addressing the question of whether Pythagoras was a mathematician and scientist. The view of Pythagoras's cosmos sketched in the first five paragraphs of this section, according to which he was neither a mathematician nor a scientist, remains the consensus."</ref>

==Other forms of the theorem==
If ''c'' denotes the [[length]] of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' denote the lengths of the other two sides, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation:
: <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2 .</math>
If the lengths of both ''a'' and ''b'' are known, then ''c'' can be calculated as
: <math> c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. </math>
If the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' and of one side (''a'' or ''b'') are known, then the length of the other side can be calculated as
: <math>a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2} </math>
or
: <math>b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}. </math>
The Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way, so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found. Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle, the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides, but less than their sum.

A generalization of this theorem is the [[law of cosines]], which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them. If the angle between the other sides is a right angle, the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation.

==Other proofs of the theorem==
This theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] being another contender for that distinction); the book ''The Pythagorean Proposition'' contains 370 proofs.<ref>{{Harv|Loomis|1968}}</ref>

===Proof using similar triangles===
[[File:Pythagoras similar triangles simplified.svg|thumb|Proof using similar triangles]]
This proof is based on the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of the sides of two [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangles, that is, upon the fact that the [[ratio]] of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles.

Let ''ABC'' represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at ''C'', as shown on the figure. Draw the [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]] from point ''C'', and call ''H'' its intersection with the side ''AB''. Point ''H'' divides the length of the hypotenuse ''c'' into parts ''d'' and ''e''. The new triangle ''ACH'' is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to triangle ''ABC'', because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at ''A'', meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as ''θ'' in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle ''CBH'' is also similar to ''ABC''. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the [[triangle postulate]]: The sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the [[parallel postulate]]. Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides:
:<math> \frac{BC}{AB}=\frac{BH}{BC} \text{ and } \frac{AC}{AB}=\frac{AH}{AC}.</math>
The first result equates the [[cosine]]s of the angles ''θ'', whereas the second result equates their [[sine]]s.

These ratios can be written as
:<math>BC^2 = AB \times BH \text{ and } AC^2=AB \times AH. </math>
Summing these two equalities results in
:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB\times BH+AB\times AH=AB\times(AH+BH)=AB^2 ,</math>
which, after simplification, expresses the Pythagorean theorem:
:<math>BC^2+AC^2=AB^2 \ .</math>

The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the ''Elements'', and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time.<ref>{{Harv|Maor|2007| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&pg=PA39&dq=%22why+did+Euclid+choose+this+particular+proof%22&hl=en&ei=WckoTLv4JIKknQecwvWoAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22why%20did%20Euclid%20choose%20this%20particular%20proof%22&f=false  39]}}</ref><ref name=Hawking>

This proof first appeared after a computer program was set to check Euclidean proofs.</ref>

===Euclid's proof===
[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|thumb|Proof in Euclid's ''Elements'']]
In outline, here is how the proof in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]], proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow.

Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a right triangle, with a right angle at ''A''. Drop a perpendicular from ''A'' to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.

For the formal proof, we require four elementary [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmata]]:
# If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent ([[side angle side|side-angle-side]]).
# The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.
# The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides.
# The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3).

Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square.<ref>See for example [http://www.slu.edu/classes/maymk/GeoGebra/Pythagoras.html Pythagorean theorem by shear mapping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014165156/http://www.slu.edu/classes/maymk/GeoGebra/Pythagoras.html |date=2016-10-14 }}, Saint Louis University website Java applet</ref>

The proof is as follows:
#Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.
#On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.<ref name=Gullberg>

#From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.
#Join CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.
#Angles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are [[Line (geometry)#Collinear points|collinear]]. Similarly for B, A, and H.
#Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.
#Since AB is equal to FB and BD is equal to BC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC.
#Since A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2)
#Since C is collinear with A and G, square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC.
#Therefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB<sup>2</sup>.
#Similarly, it can be shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC<sup>2</sup>.
#Adding these two results, AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup> = BD × BK + KL × KC
#Since BD = KL, BD × BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC
#Therefore, AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup> = BC<sup>2</sup>, since CBDE is a square.

===Proofs by dissection and rearrangement===
We have already discussed the Pythagorean proof, which was a proof by rearrangement. The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below, which consists of a large square, side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}}, containing four identical right triangles. The triangles are shown in two arrangements, the first of which leaves two squares ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup> uncovered, the second of which leaves square ''c''<sup>2</sup> uncovered. The area encompassed by the outer square never changes, and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end, so the black square areas must be equal, therefore {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>.}}

A second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area ''c''<sup>2</sup>, from four identical right triangles with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides ''a'' and ''b'' by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas ''a''<sup>2</sup> and ''b''<sup>2</sup>, which must have the same area as the initial large square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#10 |title= Pythagorean theorem, proof number 10|author=Alexander Bogomolny|author-link=Alexander Bogomolny|work=Cut the Knot |access-date=27 February 2010}}</ref>

The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called [[dissection problem|dissection]]. This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones.<ref name=specifics>{{Harv|Loomis|1968|loc= Geometric proof 22 and Figure 123| page= 113}}</ref>

===Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement===
[[File:Altitude of a right triangle.svg|thumb|Right triangle on the hypotenuse dissected into two similar right triangles on the legs, according to Einstein's proof]]
[[Albert Einstein]] gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces need not get moved.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schroeder |first=Manfred Robert |title=Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise |publisher= Courier Corporation |year=2012|pages=3–4|isbn=978-0486134789}}</ref> Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see [[#Similar figures on the three sides|Similar figures on the three sides]]).  In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself.  The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts.  Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle.  Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.

===Algebraic proofs===
[[File:Pythagoras algebraic2.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of the two algebraic proofs]]

The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', arranged inside a square with side ''c'' as in the top half of the diagram.<ref name=rotate>
{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#3 |title=Cut-the-knot.org: Pythagorean theorem and its many proofs, Proof #3 |author=Alexander Bogomolny |work=Cut the Knot |access-date=4 November 2010}}
</ref> The triangles are similar with area <math>\tfrac12ab</math>, while the small square has side {{nowrap|''b'' − ''a''}} and area {{nowrap|(''b'' − ''a'')<sup>2</sup>}}. The area of the large square is therefore

:<math>(b-a)^2+4\frac{ab}{2} = (b-a)^2+2ab = b^2-2ab+a^2+2ab = a^2+b^2. </math>

But this is a square with side ''c'' and area ''c''<sup>2</sup>, so

:<math>c^2 = a^2 + b^2. </math>

A similar proof uses four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side ''c'', as shown in the lower part of the diagram.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/index.shtml#4 |title=Cut-the-knot.org: Pythagorean theorem and its many proofs, Proof #4 |author=Alexander Bogomolny |work=Cut the Knot |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> This results in a larger square, with side {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} and area {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>2</sup>}}. The four triangles and the square side ''c'' must have the same area as the larger square,

:<math>(b+a)^2 = c^2 + 4\frac{ab}{2} = c^2+2ab,</math>

giving

:<math>c^2 = (b+a)^2 - 2ab = b^2+2ab+a^2-2ab = a^2 + b^2.</math>

The triangle ''ABC'' is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with ''BC'' the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length ''y'', the side ''AC'' of length ''x'' and the side ''AB'' of length ''a'', as seen in the lower diagram part.

[[File:Pythag differential proof.svg|thumb|Diagram for differential proof]]
If ''x'' is increased by a small amount ''dx'' by extending the side ''AC'' slightly to ''D'', then ''y'' also increases by ''dy''. These form two sides of a triangle, ''CDE'', which (with ''E'' chosen so ''CE'' is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to ''ABC''. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is:

:<math> \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac xy.</math>
This can be rewritten as <math>y \, dy=x \, dx</math> , which is a [[differential equation]] that can be solved by direct integration:
:<math>\int y \, dy=\int x \, dx\,,</math>
giving
:<math>y^2=x^2+C.</math>
The constant can be deduced from ''x'' = 0, ''y'' = ''a'' to give the equation
:<math>y^2 = x^2 + a^2.</math>
This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of ''dx'' and ''dy''.

==Converse==
The [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of the theorem is also true:<ref name=Sally1>

<blockquote>For any three positive numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>}}, there exists a triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths ''a'' and ''b''.</blockquote>

An alternative statement is:

<blockquote>For any triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', if {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>,}} then the angle between ''a'' and ''b'' measures 90°.</blockquote>

This converse also appears in Euclid's ''Elements'' (Book I, Proposition 48):<ref>

</ref> {{blockquote|text="If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right."}}

It can be proven using the [[law of cosines]] or as follows:

Let ''ABC'' be a triangle with side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', with {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>.}} Construct a second triangle with sides of length ''a'' and ''b'' containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length ''c'' = {{radic|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>}}, the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', the triangles are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' in the original triangle is a right angle.

The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proven without assuming the Pythagorean theorem.<ref>Casey, Stephen, "The converse of the theorem of Pythagoras", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 92, July 2008, 309–313.</ref><ref>Mitchell, Douglas W., "Feedback on 92.47", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 93, March 2009, 156.</ref>

A [[corollary]] of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let ''c'' be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b'' > ''c''}} (otherwise there is no triangle according to the [[triangle inequality]]).

==Consequences and uses of the theorem==

===Pythagorean triples===
{{Main article|Pythagorean triple}}
A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', such that {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''c''<sup>2</sup>.}} In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths.<ref name=Sally0/> Such a triple is commonly written {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'').}} Some well-known examples are {{nowrap|(3, 4, 5)}} and {{nowrap|(5, 12, 13).}}

A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are [[coprime]] (the [[greatest common divisor]] of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' is 1).

The following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100:
<!-- Please don't add NON-PRIMITIVE Pythagorean triples to this list such as (6,8,10) or (15,20,25) or (10,24,26). -->

===Reciprocal Pythagorean theorem===
Given a [[right triangle]] with sides <math>a,b,c</math> and [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]] <math>d</math> (a line from the right angle and perpendicular to the [[hypotenuse]] <math>c</math>). The Pythagorean theorem has,

where the denominators are squares and also for a [[heptagonal triangle]] whose sides <math>p,q,r</math> are square numbers.

===Incommensurable lengths===
[[File:Euclid Corollary 5.svg|thumb|The [[spiral of Theodorus]]: A construction for line segments with lengths whose ratios are the square root of a positive integer]]
One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] (so the ratio of which is not a [[rational number]]) can be constructed using a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|straightedge and compass]]. Pythagoras's theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the [[square root]] operation.

The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer.<ref name=Euclid_5>{{cite book |title=The Elements of Euclid: with many additional propositions, and explanatory notes, to which is prefixed an introductory essay on logic |first=Henry |last=Law |publisher=John Weale |year=1853 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ssb_OnVOGLgC&pg=PA49 |page=49 |chapter=Corollary 5 of Proposition XLVII (''Pythagoras's Theorem'')}}</ref> Each triangle has a side (labeled "1") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras's theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as {{radical|2}}, {{radical|3}}, {{radical|5}}&nbsp;. For more detail, see [[Quadratic irrational]].

Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit.<ref name=Lavine0>

===Complex numbers===
[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex number ''z'' is the distance ''r'' from ''z'' to the origin]]
For any [[complex number]]
:<math>z = x + iy,</math>
the [[absolute value]] or modulus is given by
:<math>r = |z|=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.</math>
So the three quantities, ''r'', ''x'' and ''y'' are related by the Pythagorean equation,
:<math>r^2 = x^2 + y^2.</math>
Note that ''r'' is defined to be a positive number or zero but ''x'' and ''y'' can be negative as well as positive. Geometrically ''r'' is the distance of the ''z'' from zero or the origin ''O'' in the [[complex plane]].

This can be generalised to find the distance between two points, ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> say. The required distance is given by
:<math>|z_1 - z_2|=\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2},</math>
so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation,
:<math>|z_1 - z_2|^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2.</math>

===Euclidean distance===
{{Further|Euclidean distance}}
The distance formula in [[Cartesian coordinates]] is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.<ref name=Macdonald>{{cite book |title=Mastering algorithms with Perl |author1=Jon Orwant |author2=Jarkko Hietaniemi |author3=John Macdonald |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9xMfXGoWd0C&pg=PA426 |page=426 |chapter=Euclidean distance |isbn=1-56592-398-7 |year=1999 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.}}</ref> If {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}} are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the [[Euclidean distance]], is given by

:<math> \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}. </math>

More generally, in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n''-space]], the Euclidean distance between two points, <math>A\,=\,(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)</math> and <math>B\,=\,(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)</math>, is defined, by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, as:

:<math>\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2}.</math>

If instead of Euclidean distance, the square of this value (the [[squared Euclidean distance]], or SED) is used, the resulting equation avoids square roots and is simply a sum of the SED of the coordinates:

:<math>(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2.</math>

The squared form is a smooth, [[convex function]] of both points, and is widely used in [[optimization theory]] and [[statistics]], forming the basis of [[least squares]].

===Euclidean distance in other coordinate systems===

If Cartesian coordinates are not used, for example, if [[polar coordinates]] are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if [[curvilinear coordinates]] are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the [[Legendre polynomials#Applications of Legendre polynomials in physics|applications of Legendre polynomials in physics]]. The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras's theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates {{nowrap|(''r'', ''θ'')}} can be introduced as:

:<math> x = r \cos \theta, \ y = r \sin \theta.</math>

Then two points with locations {{nowrap|(''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''θ''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''θ''<sub>2</sub>)}} are separated by a distance ''s'':

:<math>s^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 = (r_1 \cos \theta_1 -r_2 \cos \theta_2 )^2 + (r_1 \sin \theta_1 -r_2 \sin \theta_2)^2.</math>
Performing the squares and combining terms, the Pythagorean formula for distance in Cartesian coordinates produces the separation in polar coordinates as:
:<math>\begin{align}s^2 &= r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \left( \cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 +\sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 \right)\\
 &= r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \cos \left( \theta_1 - \theta_2\right)\\
 &=r_1^2 +r_2^2 -2 r_1 r_2 \cos \Delta \theta, \end{align}</math>
using the trigonometric [[List of trigonometric identities#Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities|product-to-sum formulas]]. This formula is the [[#Law of cosines|law of cosines]], sometimes called the generalized Pythagorean theorem.<ref>{{Cite book

===Pythagorean trigonometric identity===
{{Main article|Pythagorean trigonometric identity}}
[[File:Trig functions.svg|thumb|Similar right triangles showing sine and cosine of angle θ]]
In a right triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and hypotenuse ''c'', [[trigonometry]] determines the [[sine]] and [[cosine]] of the angle ''θ'' between side ''a'' and the hypotenuse as:
:<math>\sin \theta = \frac{b}{c}, \quad \cos \theta = \frac{a}{c}.</math>

From that it follows:

:<math> {\cos}^2 \theta + {\sin}^2 \theta = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{c^2} = 1,</math>

where the last step applies Pythagoras's theorem. This relation between sine and cosine is sometimes called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity.<ref name= Leff>

</ref> In similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles, and depend upon the angles. Consequently, in the figure, the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin ''θ'' and adjacent side of size cos ''θ'' in units of the hypotenuse.

===Relation to the cross product===
[[File:Cross product parallelogram.svg|right|thumb|The area of a parallelogram as a cross product; vectors '''a''' and '''b''' identify a plane and {{nowrap|'''a × b'''}} is normal to this plane.]]
The Pythagorean theorem relates the [[cross product]] and [[dot product]] in a similar way:<ref name=Massey>

</ref>

:<math> \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|^2 + (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2.</math>

This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product, as

:<math>\begin{align} \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} &= ab \mathbf{n} \sin{\theta} \\
 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &= ab \cos{\theta}, \end{align}</math>

with '''n''' a unit vector normal to both '''a''' and '''b'''. The relationship follows from these definitions and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.

This can also be used to define the cross product. By rearranging the following equation is obtained

:<math> \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 - (\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b})^2.</math>

This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition, for example in [[seven-dimensional cross product|seven dimensions]].<ref name=n_dimensions>{{cite book |title=Clifford algebras and spinors |author=Pertti Lounesto |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOsybQWDK4oC&pg=PA96 |page=96 |chapter=§7.4 Cross product of two vectors |isbn=0-521-00551-5 |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2nd}}

==Generalizations==

===Similar figures on the three sides===
A generalization of the Pythagorean theorem extending beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to [[similar figures]] was known by [[Hippocrates of Chios]] in the 5th century BC,<ref>Heath, T. L., ''A History of Greek Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 1921; reprinted by Dover, 1981.</ref> and was included by [[Euclid]] in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'':<ref name=Euclid_VI>Euclid's ''Elements'': Book VI, Proposition VI 31: "In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle."</ref>

<blockquote>If one erects similar figures (see [[Euclidean geometry]]) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side.</blockquote>

This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are ''a:b:c'').<ref name=Putz>Putz, John F. and Sipka, Timothy A. "On generalizing the Pythagorean theorem", ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 34 (4), September 2003, pp. 291–295.</ref> While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle).<ref name=Putz/>

The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' are erected on sides with corresponding lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' then:

:<math>\frac{A}{a^2} = \frac{B}{b^2} = \frac{C}{c^2}\, ,</math>
:<math>\Rightarrow A + B = \frac{a^2}{c^2}C + \frac{b^2}{c^2}C\, .</math>

But, by the Pythagorean theorem, ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''c''<sup>2</sup>, so ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C''.

Conversely, if we can prove that ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle ''C'' on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (''A'' and ''B'' ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]]. The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus ''A'' + ''B'' = ''C'' and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. (''See also [[#Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement|Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement]]'')

At any selected angle of a general triangle of sides ''a, b, c'', inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base θ are the same as the selected angle. Suppose the selected angle θ is opposite the side labeled ''c''. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle ''CAD'' with angle θ opposite side ''b'' and with side ''r'' along ''c''. A second triangle is formed with angle θ opposite side ''a'' and a side with length ''s'' along ''c'', as shown in the figure.

:<math> a^2 +b^2 =c(r+s) \ . </math>
As the angle θ approaches {{pi}}/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths ''r'' and ''s'' overlap less and less. When θ = {{pi}}/2, ''ADB'' becomes a right triangle, ''r'' + ''s'' = ''c'', and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained.

One proof observes that triangle ''ABC'' has the same angles as triangle ''CAD'', but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex B, both contain the angle θ, and so also have the same third angle by the [[triangle postulate]].) Consequently, ''ABC'' is similar to the reflection of ''CAD'', the triangle ''DAC'' in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ,
:<math>\frac{c}{b} = \frac{b}{r} \ .</math>
Likewise, for the reflection of the other triangle,
:<math>\frac{c}{a} = \frac{a}{s} \ . </math>
[[Clearing fractions]] and adding these two relations:
:<math> cs + cr = a^2 +b^2 \ , </math>
the required result.

The theorem remains valid if the angle <math> \theta </math> is obtuse so the lengths ''r'' and ''s'' are non-overlapping.

===General triangles using parallelograms===
[[File:Pythagoras for scalene triangle.svg|thumb|Generalization for arbitrary triangles,<br/>green {{nowrap|area {{=}} blue}} area]]
[[File:Pythagoras construction.svg|thumb|Construction for proof of parallelogram generalization]]
[[Pappus's area theorem]] is a further generalization, that applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares (squares are a special case, of course). The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras's theorem, and was considered a generalization by [[Pappus of Alexandria]] in 4&nbsp;AD<ref name=Jennings>For the details of such a construction, see {{cite book |title=Modern geometry with applications: with 150 figures |author=George Jennings |chapter=Figure 1.32: The generalized Pythagorean theorem |page=[https://archive.org/details/moderngeometrywi0000jenn/page/23 23] |url=https://archive.org/details/moderngeometrywi0000jenn |url-access=registration |isbn=0-387-94222-X |year=1997 |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer}}</ref><ref>Claudi Alsina, Roger B.

The lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base ''b'' and height ''h''. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms.

===Solid geometry===
{{main article|Solid geometry}}
[[File:Pythagoras 3D.svg|thumb|Pythagoras's theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides.]]
[[File:Tetrahedron vertfig.svg|thumb|A tetrahedron with outward facing right-angle corner]]
In terms of solid geometry, Pythagoras's theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure. The length of diagonal ''BD'' is found from Pythagoras's theorem as:

:<math> \overline{BD}^{\,2} = \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2} \ ,</math>

where these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal ''BD'' and the vertical edge ''AB'', the length of diagonal ''AD'' then is found by a second application of Pythagoras's theorem as:

:<math> \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BD}^{\,2} \ ,</math>
or, doing it all in one step:
:<math> \overline{AD}^{\,2} = \overline{AB}^{\,2} + \overline{BC}^{\,2} + \overline{CD}^{\,2} \ .</math>

This result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector '''v''' (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {'''v'''<sub>k</sub>} (the three mutually perpendicular sides):

This one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras's theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes.

A substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is [[de Gua's theorem]], named for [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]: If a [[tetrahedron]] has a right angle corner (like a corner of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]]), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the "''n''-dimensional Pythagorean theorem":<ref name=Bhatia>

This statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The "hypotenuse" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the "legs" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the "legs" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras's theorem applies. In a different wording:<ref name=Wong>

In an inner-product space, the '''Pythagorean theorem''' states that for any two orthogonal vectors '''v''' and '''w''' we have
:<math>\left\| \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 = \left\| \mathbf{v} \right\|^2 + \left\| \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 .</math>
Here the vectors '''v''' and '''w''' are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] '''v'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;'''w'''. This form of the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the [[Inner product space#Definition|properties of the inner product]]:
:<math>\left\| \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} \right\|^2 =\langle \mathbf{ v+w},\ \mathbf{ v+w}\rangle = \langle \mathbf{ v},\ \mathbf{ v}\rangle +\langle \mathbf{ w},\ \mathbf{ w}\rangle +\langle\mathbf{ v,\ w }\rangle + \langle\mathbf{ w,\ v }\rangle \ = \left\| \mathbf{v}\right\|^2 + \left\| \mathbf{w}\right\|^2, </math>
where the inner products of the cross terms are zero, because of orthogonality.

A further generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in an inner product space to non-orthogonal vectors is the ''[[Parallelogram equality#Normed vector spaces satisfying the parallelogram law|parallelogram law]]'' :<ref name=Saxe/>

:<math>2\|\mathbf v\|^2 +2 \|\mathbf w\|^2 = \|\mathbf {v + w} \|^2 +\| \mathbf{v-w}\|^2 \ , </math>

do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in [[spherical geometry]], all three sides of the right triangle (say ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'') bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to {{pi}}/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because 
<math> a^2 + b^2 = 2 c^2 > c^2 </math>.

Here two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered—[[spherical geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane geometry]]; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines.

However, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say ''A''+''B'' = ''C''. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters ''a'' and ''b'' equals the area of the circle with diameter ''c''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Victor Pambuccian|title=Maria Teresa Calapso's Hyperbolic Pythagorean Theorem|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=32|date=December 2010|page =2|doi=10.1007/s00283-010-9169-0|issue=4|doi-access=free}}</ref>

====Spherical geometry====
{{main article|Spherical geometry}}
[[File:Triangle sphérique.svg|thumb|Spherical triangle]]
For any right triangle on a sphere of radius ''R'' (for example, if γ in the figure is a right angle), with sides ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', the relation between the sides takes the form:<ref name=O>

</ref>

:<math> \cos \left(\frac{c}{R}\right)=\cos \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)\cos \left(\frac{b}{R}\right).</math>

This equation can be derived as a special case of the [[spherical law of cosines]] that applies to all spherical triangles:

:<math> \cos \left(\frac{c}{R}\right)=\cos \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)\cos \left(\frac{b}{R}\right) +\sin\left(\frac{a}{R}\right) \sin\left(\frac{b}{R}\right) \cos \gamma \ .</math>

By expressing the [[Maclaurin series]] for the cosine function as an [[asymptotic expansion]] with the remainder term in [[big O notation]],

:<math> \cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + O(x^4) \text{ as } x \to 0\ ,</math>

it can be shown that as the radius ''R'' approaches infinity and the arguments ''a/R'', ''b/R'', and ''c/R'' tend to zero, the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle approaches the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. Substituting the asymptotic expansion for each of the cosines into the spherical relation for a right triangle yields

:<math>1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{c}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right) = \left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right) \right]\left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{b}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right) \right] \text{ as }R\to\infty\ .</math>

The constants ''a''<sup>4</sup>, ''b''<sup>4</sup>, and ''c''<sup>4</sup> have been absorbed into the big ''O'' remainder terms since they are independent of the radius ''R''. This asymptotic relationship can be further simplified by multiplying out the bracketed quantities, cancelling the ones, multiplying through by −2, and collecting all the error terms together:

:<math>\left(\frac{c}{R}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{R}\right)^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^4}\right)\text{ as }R\to\infty\ .</math>

After multiplying through by ''R''<sup>2</sup>, the Euclidean Pythagorean relationship ''c''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> is recovered in the limit as the radius ''R'' approaches infinity (since the remainder term tends to zero):

:<math>c^2= a^2 + b^2 + O\left(\frac{1}{R^2}\right)\text{ as }R\to\infty\ .</math>

For small right triangles (''a'', ''b'' << ''R''), the cosines can be eliminated to avoid [[loss of significance]], giving
:<math> \sin^2 \frac{c}{2R} = \sin^2 \frac{a}{2R} + \sin^2 \frac{b}{2R} - 2 \sin^2 \frac{a}{2R} \sin^2 \frac{b}{2R} \,.</math>

with γ the angle at the vertex opposite the side ''c''.

By using the [[Maclaurin series]] for the hyperbolic cosine, {{nowrap|cosh ''x'' ≈ 1 + ''x''<sup>2</sup>/2}}, it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small (that is, as ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' all approach zero), the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras's theorem.

For small right triangles (''a'', ''b'' << ''R''), the hyperbolic cosines can be eliminated to avoid [[loss of significance]], giving
:<math> \sinh^2 \frac{c}{2R} = \sinh^2 \frac{a}{2R} + \sinh^2 \frac{b}{2R} + 2 \sinh^2 \frac{a}{2R} \sinh^2 \frac{b}{2R} \,.</math>

For any uniform curvature ''K'' (positive, zero, or negative), in very small right triangles (|''K''|''a''<sup>2</sup>, |''K''|''b''<sup>2</sup> << 1) with hypotenuse ''c'', it can be shown that

[[File:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|250px|Geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem from the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.]]
With contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the [[China|Chinese]] text ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]'' (周髀算经), (''The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven'') gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle—in China it is called the "'''Gougu theorem'''" (勾股定理).<ref name=Crease>
