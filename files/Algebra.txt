[[Elementary algebra]] deals with the manipulation of variables (commonly represented by [[Roman letters]]) as if they were numbers and is therefore essential in all applications of mathematics. [[Abstract algebra|"Higher" or "abstract" algebra]], which professional mathematicians typically just call "algebra", is the study of [[algebraic structure]]s that generalize the operations familiar from ordinary [[arithmetic]]. For example, a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a set with a [[binary operation]], a rule for combining two members of that set to produce a third, which satisfies some of the same basic properties as addition of integers. Other algebraic structures include [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. [[Linear algebra]], which deals with [[linear equation]]s and [[linear mapping]]s, is used for modern presentations of [[geometry]],<!-- Berger's ''Geometry'' must be cited here  --> and has many practical applications (in [[weather forecasting]], for example). There are many areas of mathematics that belong to algebra, some having "algebra" in their name, such as [[commutative algebra]], and some not, such as [[Galois theory]].

The word ''algebra'' is not only used for naming an area of mathematics and some subareas; it is also used for naming some sorts of algebraic structures, such as an [[algebra over a field]], commonly called an ''algebra''. Sometimes, the same phrase is used for a subarea and its main algebraic structures. For example, the subject known as [[Boolean algebra]] studies [[Boolean algebra (structure)|structures called Boolean algebras]]. A mathematician specialized in algebra is called an algebraist.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī.png|thumb|upright=0.8|The word ''algebra'' comes from the title of a book by [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]].<ref>Esposito, John L. (2000). ''The Oxford History of Islam''. Oxford University Press. p. 188. {{ISBN|978-0-19-988041-6}}.</ref>]]

The word ''algebra'' comes from the {{lang-ar|الجبر|lit=reunion of broken parts,<ref name="oed" /> [[bonesetting]]<ref name="CRC Press" />|translit=al-jabr}} from the title of the early 9th century book ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|ʿIlm al-jabr wa l-muqābala]]'' "The Science of Restoring and Balancing" by the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician and astronomer [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwarizmi]]. In his work, the term ''al-jabr'' referred to the operation of moving a term from one side of an equation to the other, المقابلة ''al-muqābala'' "balancing" referred to adding equal terms to both sides. Shortened to just ''algeber'' or ''algebra'' in Latin, the word eventually entered the English language during the 15th century, from either Spanish, Italian, or [[Medieval Latin]]. It originally referred to the surgical procedure of setting [[Broken bone|broken]] or [[Dislocated|dislocated bones]]. The mathematical meaning was first recorded {{in lang|en}} in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Algebra|editor=T. F. Hoad|encyclopedia=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2003|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseoxforddic00tfho|url-access=subscription|doi=10.1093/acref/9780192830982.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-283098-2}}</ref>

== Different meanings of "algebra" ==
The word "algebra" has several related meanings in mathematics, as a single word or with qualifiers.
* As a single word without an [[Article_(grammar)|article]], "algebra" names a broad part of mathematics.
* As a single word with an article or in the plural, "an algebra" or "algebras" denotes a specific mathematical structure, whose precise definition depends on the context. Usually, the structure has an addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication (see [[Algebra over a field]]). When some authors use the term "algebra", they make a subset of the following additional assumptions: [[Associative property|associative]], [[Commutative property|commutative]], [[Unital algebra|unital]], and/or finite-dimensional. In [[universal algebra]], the word "algebra" refers to a generalization of the above concept, which allows for [[Operation (mathematics)|n-ary operations]].
* With a qualifier, there is the same distinction:
** Without an article, it means a part of algebra, such as [[linear algebra]], [[elementary algebra]] (the symbol-manipulation rules taught in elementary courses of mathematics as part of [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]]), or [[abstract algebra]] (the study of the algebraic structures for themselves).
** With an article, it means an instance of some algebraic structure, like a [[Lie algebra]], an [[associative algebra]], or a [[vertex operator algebra]].
** Sometimes both meanings exist for the same qualifier, as in the sentence: ''[[Commutative algebra]] is the study of [[commutative ring]]s, which are [[algebra (ring theory)|commutative algebras]] over the integers''.

== Algebra as a branch of mathematics ==

Algebra began with computations similar to those of [[arithmetic]], with letters standing for numbers.<ref name=citeboyer /> This allowed proofs of properties that are true no matter which numbers are involved. For example, in the [[quadratic equation]]
:<math>ax^2+bx+c=0,</math>
<math>a, b, c</math> can be any numbers whatsoever (except that <math>a</math> cannot be <math>0</math>), and the [[quadratic formula]] can be used to quickly and easily find the values of the unknown quantity <math>x</math> which satisfy the equation. That is to say, to find all the solutions of the equation.

Historically, and in current teaching, the study of algebra starts with the solving of equations, such as the quadratic equation above. Then more general questions, such as "does an equation have a [[Solution (equation)|solution]]?", "how many [[Zero of a function|solutions]] does an equation have?", "what can be said about the nature of the solutions?" are considered. These questions led extending algebra to non-numerical objects, such as [[permutation]]s, [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and [[polynomial]]s. The structural properties of these non-numerical objects were then formalized into [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[field (mathematics)|fields]].

Before the 16th century, mathematics was divided into only two subfields, [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]]. Even though some methods, which had been developed much earlier, may be considered nowadays as algebra, the emergence of algebra and, soon thereafter, of [[infinitesimal calculus]] as subfields of mathematics only dates from the 16th or 17th century. From the second half of the 19th century on, many new fields of mathematics appeared, most of which made use of both arithmetic and geometry, and almost all of which used algebra.

Today, algebra has grown considerably and includes many branches of mathematics, as can be seen in the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html|title=2010 Mathematics Subject Classification|access-date=2014-10-05|archive-date=2014-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606010248/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html|url-status=live}}</ref> where none of the first level areas (two digit entries) are called ''algebra''. Today algebra includes section 08-General algebraic systems, 12-[[Field theory (mathematics)|Field theory]] and [[polynomial]]s, 13-[[Commutative algebra]], 15-[[Linear algebra|Linear]] and [[multilinear algebra]]; [[matrix theory]], 16-[[associative algebra|Associative rings and algebras]], 17-[[Nonassociative ring]]s and [[Non-associative algebra|algebras]], 18-[[Category theory]]; [[homological algebra]], 19-[[K-theory]] and 20-[[Group theory]]. Algebra is also used extensively in 11-[[Number theory]] and 14-[[Algebraic geometry]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of algebra|Abstract algebra#History|Timeline of algebra}}

The use of the word "algebra" for denoting a part of mathematics dates probably from the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}} The word is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] ''al-jabr'' that appears in the title of the treatise ''[[Al-Kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-gabr wa-l-muqabala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing''), written in circa 820 by [[Al-Kwarizmi]].

''Al-jabr'' referred to a method for transforming [[equation (mathematics)|equation]]s by subtracting [[like terms]] from both sides, or passing one term from one side to the other, after changing its sign.

Therefore, ''algebra'' referred originally to the manipulation of equations, and, by extension, to the [[theory of equations]]. This is still what historians of mathematics generally mean by the term ''algebra''.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In mathematics, the meaning of ''algebra'' has evolved after the introduction by [[François Viète]] of symbols ([[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s) for denoting unknown or incompletely specified numbers, and the resulting use of the [[mathematical notation]] for equations and [[formula]]s. So, algebra became essentially the study of the action of [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on [[expression (mathematics)|expression]]s involving variables. This includes but is not limited to the theory of equations.

At the beginning of the 20th century, algebra evolved further by considering operations that act not only on numbers but also on elements of so-called [[mathematical structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s and [[vector space]]s. This new algebra was called ''[[Moderne Algebra|modern algebra]]'' by [[van der Waerden]] in his eponymous treatise, whose name has been changed to ''Algebra'' in later editions.

=== Early history ===
[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A page from [[:en:Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwārizmī]]'s ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala]]'']]

The roots of algebra can be traced back to the ancient [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Struik |first=Dirk J. |year=1987 |title=A Concise History of Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-60255-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof0000stru_m6j1 }}</ref> who developed an advanced arithmetical system with which they were able to do calculations in an [[algorithm]]ic fashion. The Babylonians developed formulas to calculate solutions for problems typically solved today by using [[linear equation]]s, [[quadratic equation]]s, and [[indeterminate equation|indeterminate linear equations]]. By contrast, most [[Ancient Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] of this era, as well as [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] and [[Chinese mathematics]] in the 1st millennium BC, usually solved such equations by geometric methods, such as those described in the ''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]'', [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], and ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''. The geometric work of the Greeks, typified in the ''Elements'', provided the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations, although this would not be realized until [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics developed in medieval Islam]].<ref>See {{harvnb|Boyer|1991}}.</ref>

By the time of [[Plato]], Greek mathematics had undergone a drastic change. The Greeks created a [[Greek geometric algebra|geometric algebra]] where terms were represented by sides of geometric objects, usually lines, that had letters associated with them.<ref name=citeboyer>See {{harvnb|Boyer|1991}}, ''Europe in the Middle Ages'', p. 258: "In the arithmetical theorems in Euclid's ''Elements'' VII–IX, numbers had been represented by line segments to which letters had been attached, and the geometric proofs in al-Khwarizmi's ''Algebra'' made use of lettered diagrams; but all coefficients in the equations used in the ''Algebra'' are specific numbers, whether represented by numerals or written out in words. The idea of generality is implied in al-Khwarizmi's exposition, but he had no scheme for expressing algebraically the general propositions that are so readily available in geometry."</ref> [[Diophantus]] (3rd century AD) was an [[Alexandria]]n Greek mathematician and the author of a series of books called ''[[Arithmetica]]''. These texts deal with solving [[algebraic equation]]s,<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Florian Cajori |first=Florian |last=Cajori |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ2Us3F7dSwC&pg=PA34 |title=A History of Elementary Mathematics – With Hints on Methods of Teaching |page=34 |publisher=Read Books Design |isbn=978-1-4460-2221-4 |access-date=2020-10-15 |archive-date=2021-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221075950/https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ2Us3F7dSwC&pg=PA34 |url-status=live }}</ref> and have led, in [[number theory]], to the modern notion of [[Diophantine equation]].

Earlier traditions discussed above had a direct influence on the [[History of Iran|Persian]] mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] ({{circa|780}}–850). He later wrote ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'', which established algebra as a mathematical discipline that is independent of [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Al Khwarizmi: The Beginnings of Algebra|author=Roshdi Rashed|publisher=Saqi Books|date= 2009|isbn=978-0-86356-430-7}}</ref>

In the context where algebra is identified with the [[theory of equations]], the Greek mathematician Diophantus has traditionally been known as the "father of algebra" and in the context where it is identified with rules for manipulating and solving equations, Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi is regarded as "the father of algebra".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Corona|first=Brezina|title=Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra|publisher=Rosen Pub Group|date= 2006|isbn=978-1404205130|location=New York, United States}}</ref><ref>See {{harvnb|Boyer|1991}}, page 181: "If we think primarily of the matter of notations, Diophantus has good claim to be known as the 'father of algebra', but in terms of motivation and concept, the claim is less appropriate.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Gerolamo Cardano (colour).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian mathematician [[Girolamo Cardano]] published the solutions to the [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s in his 1545 book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars magna]]''.]]

[[François Viète]]'s work on [[new algebra]] at the close of the 16th century was an important step towards modern algebra. In 1637, [[René Descartes]] published ''[[La Géométrie]]'', inventing [[analytic geometry]] and introducing modern algebraic notation. Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a [[determinant]] was developed by [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese mathematician]] [[Seki Kōwa]] in the 17th century, followed independently by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. [[Gabriel Cramer]] also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. Permutations were studied by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in his 1770 paper "''Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations''{{-"}} devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in which he introduced [[Resolvent (Galois theory)|Lagrange resolvents]]. [[Paolo Ruffini (mathematician)|Paolo Ruffini]] was the first person to develop the theory of [[permutation group]]s, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations.

[[Abstract algebra]] was developed in the 19th century, deriving from the interest in solving equations, initially focusing on what is now called [[Galois theory]], and on [[constructible number|constructibility]] issues.<ref>"[http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/algebra/history.html The Origins of Abstract Algebra] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611091009/http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~lee/algebra/history.html |date=2010-06-11 }}".

[[File:Mathematics lecture at the Helsinki University of Technology.jpg|thumb|[[Linear algebra]] lecture at the [[Aalto University]]]]

Some subareas of algebra have the word algebra in their name; [[linear algebra]] is one example. Others do not: [[group theory]], [[ring theory]], and [[field (mathematics)|field theory]] are examples. In this section, we list some areas of mathematics with the word "algebra" in the name.
* [[Elementary algebra]], the part of algebra that is usually taught in elementary courses of mathematics.
* [[Abstract algebra]], in which [[algebraic structure]]s such as [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are [[axiomatization|axiomatically]] defined and investigated.
* [[Linear algebra]], in which the specific properties of [[linear equation]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] are studied.
* [[Boolean algebra]], a branch of algebra abstracting the computation with the [[truth value]]s ''false'' and ''true''.
* [[Commutative algebra]], the study of [[commutative ring]]s.
* [[Computer algebra]], the implementation of algebraic methods as [[algorithm]]s and [[computer program]]s.
* [[Homological algebra]], the study of algebraic structures that are fundamental to study [[topological space]]s.
* [[Universal algebra]], in which properties common to all algebraic structures are studied.
* [[Algebraic number theory]], in which the properties of numbers are studied from an algebraic point of view.
* [[Algebraic geometry]], a branch of geometry, in its primitive form specifying curves and surfaces as solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s.
* [[Algebraic combinatorics]], in which algebraic methods are used to study combinatorial questions.
* [[Relational algebra]]: a set of [[finitary relation]]s that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under certain operators.

Many mathematical structures are called algebras:
* [[Algebra over a field]] or more generally [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra over a ring]].<br />Many classes of algebras over a field or over a ring have a specific name:
** [[Associative algebra]]
** [[Non-associative algebra]]
** [[Lie algebra]]
** [[Composition algebra]]
** [[Hopf algebra]]
** [[C*-algebra]]
** [[Symmetric algebra]]
** [[Exterior algebra]]
** [[Tensor algebra]]
* In [[measure theory]],
** [[Sigma-algebra]]
** [[Algebra over a set]]
* In [[category theory]]
** [[F-algebra]] and [[F-coalgebra]]
** [[T-algebra]]
* In [[logic]],
** [[Relation algebra]], a residuated Boolean algebra expanded with an involution called converse.
** [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], a [[complemented lattice|complemented]] [[distributive lattice]].
** [[Heyting algebra]]

Elementary algebra is the most basic form of algebra. It is taught to students who are presumed to have no knowledge of [[mathematics]] beyond the basic principles of [[arithmetic]]. In arithmetic, only [[number]]s and their arithmetical operations (such as +, −, ×, ÷) occur. In algebra, numbers are often represented by symbols called [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] (such as ''a'', ''n'', ''x'', ''y'' or ''z''). This is useful because:
* It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' for all ''a'' and ''b''), and thus is the first step to a systematic exploration of the properties of the [[real number|real number system]].
* It allows the reference to "unknown" numbers, the formulation of [[equation]]s and the study of how to solve these. (For instance, "Find a number ''x'' such that 3''x'' + 1 = 10" or going a bit further "Find a number ''x'' such that ''ax'' + ''b'' = ''c''". This step leads to the conclusion that it is not the nature of the specific numbers that allow us to solve it, but that of the operations involved.)
* It allows the formulation of [[function (mathematics)|functional]] relationships. (For instance, "If you sell ''x'' tickets, then your profit will be 3''x'' − 10 dollars, or ''f''(''x'') = 3''x'' − 10, where ''f'' is the function, and ''x'' is the number to which the function is applied".)

=== Polynomials ===
{{Main|Polynomial}}
[[File:Polynomialdeg3.svg|The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a polynomial function of degree 3|thumb|upright=0.8]]

A polynomial is an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] that is the sum of a finite number of non-zero [[Summand|terms]], each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] raised to whole number powers. For example, ''x''<sup>2</sup> + 2''x'' − 3 is a polynomial in the single variable ''x''. A polynomial expression is an expression that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (''x'' − 1)(''x'' + 3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or, equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the same polynomial function.

Two important and related problems in algebra are the [[factorization of polynomials]], that is, expressing a given polynomial as a product of other polynomials that cannot be factored any further, and the computation of [[polynomial greatest common divisor]]s. The example polynomial above can be factored as (''x'' − 1)(''x'' + 3). A related class of problems is finding algebraic expressions for the [[root of a function|roots]] of a polynomial in a single variable.

=== Education ===
{{See also|Mathematics education}}

It has been suggested that elementary algebra should be taught to students as young as eleven years old,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hull's Algebra |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 1904 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/07/16/101345282.pdf |access-date=2012-09-21 |archive-date=2021-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221075950/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/07/16/101345282.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> though in recent years it is more common for public lessons to begin at the eighth grade level (≈&nbsp;13&nbsp;y.o.&nbsp;±) in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Quaid |first=Libby |title=Kids misplaced in algebra |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-09-22 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-09-22-357650952_x.htm |format=Report |access-date=2012-09-23 |archive-date=2011-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027033958/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-09-22-357650952_x.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> However, in some US schools, algebra instruction starts in ninth grade.

== Abstract algebra ==
{{Main|Abstract algebra|Algebraic structure}}

Abstract algebra extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and [[arithmetic]] of [[number]]s to more general concepts. Here are the listed fundamental concepts in abstract algebra.

[[Set (mathematics)|Sets]]: Rather than just considering the different types of [[number]]s, abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of ''sets'': collections of objects called [[Element (mathematics)|elements]]. All collections of the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets include the set of all two-by-two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], the set of all second-degree [[polynomials]] (''ax''<sup>2</sup> + ''bx'' + ''c''), the set of all two dimensional [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] of a plane, and the various [[finite groups]] such as the [[cyclic group]]s, which are the groups of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n''. [[Set theory]] is a branch of [[logic]] and not technically a branch of algebra.

[[Binary operation]]s: The notion of [[addition]] (+) is generalized to the notion of ''binary operation'' (denoted here by ∗). The notion of binary operation is meaningless without the set on which the operation is defined. For two elements ''a'' and ''b'' in a set ''S'', ''a'' ∗ ''b'' is another element in the set; this condition is called [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]. [[Addition]] (+), [[subtraction]] (−), [[multiplication]] (×), and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] (÷) can be binary operations when defined on different sets, as are addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.

[[Identity element]]s: The numbers zero and one are generalized to give the notion of an ''identity element'' for an operation. Zero is the identity element for addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general binary operator ∗ the identity element ''e'' must satisfy ''a'' ∗ ''e'' = ''a'' and ''e'' ∗ ''a'' = ''a'', and is necessarily unique, if it exists. This holds for addition as ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' and 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' and multiplication ''a'' × 1 = ''a'' and 1 × ''a'' = ''a''. Not all sets and operator combinations have an identity element; for example, the set of positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3,&nbsp;...) has no identity element for addition.

[[Inverse elements]]: The negative numbers give rise to the concept of ''inverse elements''. For addition, the inverse of ''a'' is written −''a'', and for multiplication the inverse is written ''a''<sup>−1</sup>. A general two-sided inverse element ''a''<sup>−1</sup> satisfies the property that ''a'' ∗ ''a''<sup>−1</sup> = ''e'' and ''a''<sup>−1</sup> ∗ ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.

[[Associativity]]: Addition of integers has a property called associativity. That is, the grouping of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For example: {{nowrap|1=(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)}}. In general, this becomes (''a'' ∗ ''b'') ∗ ''c'' = ''a'' ∗ (''b'' ∗ ''c''). This property is shared by most binary operations, but not subtraction or division or [[octonion multiplication]].

[[Commutative operation|Commutativity]]: Addition and multiplication of real numbers are both commutative. That is, the order of the numbers does not affect the result. For example: 2 + 3 = 3 + 2. In general, this becomes ''a'' ∗ ''b'' = ''b'' ∗ ''a''. This property does not hold for all binary operations. For example, [[matrix multiplication]] and [[Quaternion|quaternion multiplication]] are both non-commutative.

=== Groups ===
{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}
{{See also|Group theory|Examples of groups}}

Combining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in mathematics: a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. A group is a combination of a set ''S'' and a single [[binary operation]] ∗, defined in any way you choose, but with the following properties:
* An identity element ''e'' exists, such that for every member ''a'' of ''S'', ''e'' ∗ ''a'' and ''a'' ∗ ''e'' are both identical to ''a''.
* Every element has an inverse: for every member ''a'' of ''S'', there exists a member ''a''<sup>−1</sup> such that ''a'' ∗ ''a''<sup>−1</sup> and ''a''<sup>−1</sup> ∗ ''a'' are both identical to the identity element.
* The operation is associative: if ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are members of ''S'', then (''a'' ∗ ''b'') ∗ ''c'' is identical to ''a'' ∗ (''b'' ∗ ''c'').

If a group is also [[commutativity|commutative]] – that is, for any two members ''a'' and ''b'' of ''S'', ''a'' ∗ ''b'' is identical to ''b'' ∗ ''a'' – then the group is said to be [[Abelian group|abelian]].

For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group. In this group, the identity element is 0 and the inverse of any element ''a'' is its negation, −''a''. The associativity requirement is met, because for any integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'')

The non-zero [[rational number]]s form a group under multiplication. Here, the identity element is 1, since 1 × ''a'' = ''a'' × 1 = ''a'' for any rational number ''a''. The inverse of ''a'' is {{sfrac|1|''a''}}, since ''a'' × {{sfrac|1|''a''}} = 1.

The integers under the multiplication operation, however, do not form a group. This is because, in general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer. For example, 4 is an integer, but its multiplicative inverse is {{sfrac|1|4}}, which is not an integer.

The theory of groups is studied in [[group theory]]. A major result of this theory is the [[classification of finite simple groups]], mostly published between about 1955 and 1983, which separates the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s into roughly 30 basic types.

[[Semi-group]]s, [[quasi-group]]s, and [[monoid]]s are [[algebraic structure]]s similar to groups, but with less constraints on the operation. They comprise a set and a closed binary operation but do not necessarily satisfy the other conditions. A [[semi-group]] has an ''associative'' binary operation but might not have an identity element. A [[monoid]] is a semi-group which does have an identity but might not have an inverse for every element. A [[quasi-group]] satisfies a requirement that any element can be turned into any other by either a unique left-multiplication or right-multiplication; however, the binary operation might not be associative.

All groups are monoids, and all monoids are semi-groups.

=== Rings and fields ===
{{Main|Ring (mathematics)|Field (mathematics)}}
{{See also|Ring theory|Glossary of ring theory|Field theory (mathematics)|Glossary of field theory}}

Groups just have one binary operation. To fully explain the behaviour of the different types of numbers, structures with two operators need to be studied. The most important of these are [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[Field (mathematics)|fields]].

A [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] has two binary operations (+) and (×), with × distributive over +. Under the first operator (+) it forms an ''abelian group''. Under the second operator (×) it is associative, but it does not need to have an identity, or inverse, so division is not required. The additive (+) identity element is written as 0 and the additive inverse of ''a'' is written as −''a''.

[[Distributivity]] generalises the ''distributive law'' for numbers. For the integers {{nowrap|1=(''a'' + ''b'') × ''c'' = ''a'' × ''c'' + ''b'' × ''c''}} and {{nowrap|1=''c'' × (''a'' + ''b'') = ''c'' × ''a'' + ''c'' × ''b'',}} and × is said to be ''distributive'' over +.

The integers are an example of a ring. The integers have additional properties which make it an [[integral domain]].

A [[Field (mathematics)|field]] is a ''ring'' with the additional property that all the elements excluding 0 form an ''abelian group'' under ×. The multiplicative (×) identity is written as 1 and the multiplicative inverse of ''a'' is written as ''a''<sup>−1</sup>.

The rational numbers, the real numbers and the complex numbers are all examples of fields.
