In physics, '''gravity''' ({{Etymology|lat|gravitas|weight}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://browse.dict.cc/latin-english/gravitas.html |title=dict.cc dictionary :: gravitas :: English-Latin translation |access-date=11 September 2018 |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813203625/https://browse.dict.cc/latin-english/gravitas.html |url-status=live }}</ref>) is a [[fundamental interaction]] which causes mutual attraction between all things that have [[mass]]. Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 10<sup>38</sup> times weaker than the [[strong interaction]], 10<sup>36</sup> times weaker than the [[electromagnetic force]] and 10<sup>29</sup> times weaker than the [[weak interaction]]. As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of [[subatomic particle]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Scientific Development and Misconceptions Through the Ages: A Reference Guide |edition=illustrated |first1=Robert E. |last1=Krebs |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30226-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/scientificdevelo0000kreb/page/133 133] |url=https://archive.org/details/scientificdevelo0000kreb|url-access=registration }}</ref> However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the [[macroscopic scale]], and it determines the motion of [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and even [[Electromagnetic radiation|light]].

[[Gravity of Earth|On Earth]], gravity gives [[weight]] to [[physical object]]s, and the [[gravitation of the Moon|Moon's gravity]] is responsible for sublunar [[tide]]s in the oceans (the corresponding antipodal tide is caused by the inertia of the Earth and Moon orbiting one another). Gravity also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of [[gravitropism]] and influencing the [[Circulatory system|circulation]] of fluids in [[multicellular organism]]s.

The gravitational attraction between the original gaseous matter in the [[universe]] caused it to [[coalescence (physics)|coalesce]] and [[star formation|form stars]] which eventually condensed into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.

Gravity is most accurately described by the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] (proposed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]], caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along [[geodesic]] lines. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a [[black hole]], from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the black hole's [[event horizon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/home.html|title=HubbleSite: Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull|website=hubblesite.org|access-date=7 October 2016|archive-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226185228/http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/home.html|url-status=live}}</ref> However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which describes gravity as a [[force]] causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the product of their masses and [[inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] between them.

==History==
{{main|History of gravitational theory}}

===Ancient world===
The nature and mechanism of gravity were explored by a wide range of ancient scholars. In [[Greece]], [[Aristotle]] believed that objects fell towards the Earth because the Earth was the center of the Universe and attracted all of the mass in the Universe towards it. He also thought that the speed of a falling object should increase with its weight, a conclusion that was later shown to be false.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cappi |first=Alberto |title=The concept of gravity before Newton |url=http://www.cultureandcosmos.org/pdfs/16/Cappi_INSAPVII_Gravity_before_Newton.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.cultureandcosmos.org/pdfs/16/Cappi_INSAPVII_Gravity_before_Newton.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |website=Culture and Cosmos}}</ref> While Aristotle's view was widely accepted throughout Ancient Greece, there were other thinkers such as [[Plutarch]] who correctly predicted that the attraction of gravity was not unique to the Earth.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bakker |first1=Frederik |last2=Palmerino |first2=Carla Rita |date=2020-06-01 |title=Motion to the Center or Motion to the Whole?

In the 6th century CE, the Byzantine Alexandrian scholar John Philoponus proposed the theory of impetus, which modifies Aristotle's theory that "continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force" by incorporating a causative force that diminishes over time.

In [[India]] in the seventh century CE, [[Brahmagupta]] proposed the idea that gravity is an attractive force that draws objects to the Earth and used the term ''[[wikt:गुरुत्वाकर्षण|gurutvākarṣaṇ]]'' to describe it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pickover |first1=Clifford |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQXcpvjcJBUC&pg=PA105 |title=Archimedes to Hawking: Laws of Science and the Great Minds Behind Them |date=2008-04-16 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199792689 |language=en |access-date=29 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118060420/https://books.google.com/books?id=SQXcpvjcJBUC |archive-date=18 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bose |first1=Mainak Kumar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbItAAAAMAAJ&q=gravity |title=Late classical India |publisher=A.

===Newton's theory of gravitation===
{{main|Newton's law of universal gravitation}}
[[File:Portrait of Sir Isaac Newton, 1689.jpg|thumb|upright|left|English physicist and mathematician, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727)]]

In 1684, Newton sent a manuscript to [[Edmond Halley]] titled ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]] ('On the motion of bodies in an orbit')'', which provided a physical justification for [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].<ref name="Sagan-1997">{{cite book |last1=Sagan |first1=Carl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LhkoowKFaTsC |title=Comet |last2=Druyan |first2=Ann |publisher=Random House |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-3078-0105-0 |location=New York |pages=52–58 |author-link1=Carl Sagan |author-link2=Ann Druyan |access-date=5 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210615020250/https://books.google.com/books?id=LhkoowKFaTsC |archive-date=15 June 2021 |url-status=live |name-list-style=amp}}</ref> Halley was impressed by the manuscript and urged Newton to expand on it, and a few years later Newton published a groundbreaking book called ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy''). In this book, Newton described gravitation as a universal force, and claimed  that "the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve." This statement was later condensed into the following inverse-square law:

<math display="block">F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}, </math>where {{mvar|F}} is the force, {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}} are the masses of the objects interacting, {{mvar|r}} is the distance between the centers of the masses and {{math|''G''}} is the [[gravitational constant]] {{physconst|G|after=.|round=3}}

Newton's ''Principia'' was well received by the scientific community, and his law of gravitation quickly spread across the European world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Reception of Newton's Principia |url=http://physics.ucsc.edu/~michael/newtonreception6.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://physics.ucsc.edu/~michael/newtonreception6.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=May 6, 2022}}</ref> More than a century later, in 1821, his theory of gravitation rose to even greater prominence when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]]. In that year, the French astronomer [[Alexis Bouvard]] used this theory to create a table modeling the orbit of [[Uranus]], which was shown to differ significantly from the planet's actual trajectory. In order to explain this discrepancy, many astronomers speculated that there might be a large object beyond the orbit of Uranus which was disrupting its<!--Uranus's--> orbit. In 1846, the astronomers [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] independently used Newton's law to predict Neptune's location in the night sky, and the planet was discovered there within a day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=This Month in Physics History |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/202008/history.cfm |access-date=2022-05-06 |website=www.aps.org |language=en}}</ref>

===General relativity===
{{see also|Introduction to general relativity}}
{{General relativity sidebar}}
Eventually, astronomers noticed an eccentricity in the orbit of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] which could not be explained by Newton's theory: the [[perihelion]] of the orbit was increasing by about 42.98 [[arcseconds]] per century. The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy was an as-yet-undiscovered celestial body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury), but all efforts to find such a body turned out to be fruitless. Finally, in 1915, [[Albert Einstein]] developed a theory of [[general relativity]] which was able to accurately model Mercury's orbit.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nobil |first=Anna M. |date=March 1986 |title=The real value of Mercury's perihelion advance |journal=Nature |volume=320 |issue=6057 |pages=39–41 |bibcode=1986Natur.320...39N |doi=10.1038/320039a0 |s2cid=4325839}}</ref>

In general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to [[spacetime]] [[curvature]] instead of a force. Einstein began to toy with this idea in the form of the [[equivalence principle]], a discovery which he later described as "the happiest thought of my life."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Joh |last2=Dougan |first2=Darren |date=November 23, 2015 |title=Without Einstein it would have taken decades longer to understand gravity |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-11-einstein-decades-longer-gravity.html#:~:text=In%201907%2C%20Einstein%20had%20the,not%20feel%20his%20own%20weight. |access-date=May 21, 2022}}</ref> In this theory, free fall is considered to be equivalent to inertial motion, meaning that free-falling inertial objects are accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |title=Gravity and Warped Spacetime |publisher=black-holes.org |access-date=16 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621005940/http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |archive-date=21 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lecture 20: Black Holes – The Einstein Equivalence Principle |author=Dmitri Pogosyan |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |publisher=University of Alberta |access-date=14 October 2011 |archive-date=8 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908024651/http://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In contrast to [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]], Einstein believed that it was possible for this acceleration to occur without any force being applied to the object.

Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]]. As in Newton's first law of motion, Einstein believed that a force applied to an object would cause it to deviate from a geodesic. For instance, people standing on the surface of the Earth are prevented from following a geodesic path because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on them. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.

Einstein's description of gravity was quickly accepted by the majority of physicists, as it was able to explain a wide variety of previously baffling experimental results.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Brush |first=S.

A major area of research is the discovery of [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] to the Einstein field equations. Solving these equations amounts to calculating a precise value for the metric tensor (which defines the curvature and geometry of spacetime) under certain physical conditions. There is no formal definition for what constitutes such solutions, but most scientists agree that they should be expressable using [[elementary functions]] or [[linear differential equations]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ishak |first=Mustafa |title=Exact Solutions to Einstein's Equations in Astrophysics |url=https://personal.utdallas.edu/~mishak/ExactSolutionsInAstrophysics_Ishak_Final.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://personal.utdallas.edu/~mishak/ExactSolutionsInAstrophysics_Ishak_Final.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=May 25, 2022 |website=University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref> Some of the most notable solutions of the equations include:

Today, there remain many important situations in which the Einstein field equations have not been solved. Chief among these is the [[two-body problem]], which concerns the geometry of spacetime around two mutually interacting massive objects (such as the Sun and the Earth, or the two stars in a [[binary star system]]). The situation gets even more complicated when considering the interactions of three or more massive bodies (the "''n''-body problem"), and some scientists suspect that the Einstein field equations will never be solved in this context.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Siegel |first=Ethan |title=This Is Why Scientists Will Never Exactly Solve General Relativity |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/12/04/this-is-why-scientists-will-never-exactly-solve-general-relativity/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref> However, it is still possible to construct an approximate solution to the field equations in the ''n''-body problem by using the technique of [[post-Newtonian expansion]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Spyrou |first=N. |date=1975-05-01 |title=The ''N''-body problem in general relativity. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=197 |pages=725–743 |doi=10.1086/153562 |bibcode=1975ApJ...197..725S |issn=0004-637X|doi-access=free }}</ref> In general, the extreme nonlinearity of the Einstein field equations makes it difficult to solve them in all but the most specific cases.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sleator |first=Daniel |date=June 6, 1996 |title=Hermeneutics of Classical General Relativity |url=https://physics.nyu.edu/sokal/transgress_v2/node2.html |access-date=May 23, 2022}}</ref>

===Gravity and quantum mechanics===
{{Main|Graviton|Quantum gravity}}

Despite its success in predicting the effects of gravity at large scales, general relativity is ultimately incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]]. This is because general relativity describes gravity as a smooth, continuous distortion of spacetime, while quantum mechanics holds that all forces arise from the exchange of discrete particles known as [[quantum|quanta]]. This contradiction is especially vexing to physicists because the other three fundamental forces (strong force, weak force and electromagnetism) were reconciled with a quantum framework decades ago.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gravity Probe B – Special & General Relativity Questions and Answers |url=https://einstein.stanford.edu/content/relativity/a11758.html#:~:text=Quantum%20mechanics%20is%20incompatible%20with,exchange%20of%20well-defined%20quanta. |access-date=2022-08-01 |website=einstein.stanford.edu}}</ref> As a result, modern researchers have begun to search for a theory that could unite both gravity and quantum mechanics under a more general framework.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Huggett |first1=Nick |title=Beyond Spacetime: The Foundations of Quantum Gravity |last2=Matsubara |first2=Keizo |last3=Wüthrich |first3=Christian |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2020 |isbn=9781108655705 |pages=6 |language=en}}</ref>

One path is to describe gravity in the framework of [[quantum field theory]], which has been successful to accurately describe the other [[fundamental interaction]]s. The electromagnetic force arises from an exchange of virtual [[photon]]s, where the QFT description of gravity is that there is an exchange of [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[graviton]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Feynman |first= R.P. |author2=Morinigo, F.B. |author3=Wagner, W.G. |author4=Hatfield, B.  |title= Feynman lectures on gravitation |url= https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0000feyn_g4q1 |url-access= registration |publisher= Addison-Wesley |date= 1995 |isbn=978-0-201-62734-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Zee, A. |title=Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell | publisher = Princeton University Press | date=2003 | isbn=978-0-691-01019-9}}</ref> This description reproduces general relativity in the [[classical limit]].

=== Tests of general relativity ===
Testing the predictions of general relativity has historically been difficult, because they are almost identical to the predictions of Newtonian gravity for small energies and masses.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=Testing General Relativity |url=https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2015/11/27/testing-general-relativity/ |access-date=2022-05-29 |website=NASA Blueshift |language=en-US}}</ref> Still, since its development, an ongoing series of experimental results have provided support for the theory:<ref name="auto"/>

===Earth's gravity===

{{main|Gravity of Earth}}
Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own gravitational field, which can be conceptualized with Newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetrical planet, the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body's mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body.
[[File:Gravity action-reaction.gif|thumb|left|If an object with comparable mass to that of the Earth were to fall towards it, then the corresponding acceleration of the Earth would be observable.]]
The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence.<ref>{{cite book |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |first1=G.N. |last1=Cantor |first2=J.R.R. |last2=Christie |first3=M.J.S. |last3=Hodge |first4=R.C. |last4=Olby |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-134-97751-2 |page=448 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&pg=PA448 |access-date=22 October 2017 |archive-date=17 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117131121/https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&pg=PA448 |url-status=live }}</ref> The rate of acceleration of falling objects near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities.<ref>{{Cite APOD|date = 15 December 2014|title = The Potsdam Gravity Potato|access-date = }}</ref> For purposes of weights and measures, a [[standard gravity]] value is defined by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], under the [[International System of Units]] (SI).

===Gravitational radiation===
[[File:LIGO Hanford aerial 05.jpg|alt=LIGO Hanford Observatory|thumb|The [[LIGO]] Hanford Observatory located in Washington, United States, where gravitational waves were first observed in September 2015]]
{{Main|Gravitational wave}}
General relativity predicts that energy can be transported out of a system through gravitational radiation. The first indirect evidence for gravitational radiation was through measurements of the [[Hulse–Taylor binary]] in 1973. This system consists of a pulsar and neutron star in orbit around one another. Its orbital period has decreased since its initial discovery due to a loss of energy, which is consistent for the amount of energy loss due to gravitational radiation. This research was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The first direct evidence for gravitational radiation was measured on 14 September 2015 by the [[LIGO]] detectors.

===Speed of gravity===
{{Main|Speed of gravity}}
In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of [[Earth tide]]s during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.<ref>[http://www.astrowatch.net/2012/12/chinese-scientists-find-evidence-for.html Chinese scientists find evidence for speed of gravity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108083729/http://www.astrowatch.net/2012/12/chinese-scientists-find-evidence-for.html |date=8 January 2013 }}, astrowatch.com, 12/28/12.</ref> This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting the vacant point normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that distance. The team's findings were released in ''[[Science Bulletin]]'' in February 2013.<ref>{{cite journal|last=TANG|first=Ke Yun|author2=HUA ChangCai |author3=WEN Wu |author4=CHI ShunLiang |author5=YOU QingYu |author6=YU Dan |title=Observational evidences for the speed of the gravity based on the Earth tide|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|date=February 2013|volume=58|issue=4–5|pages=474–477|doi=10.1007/s11434-012-5603-3|bibcode=2013ChSBu..58..474T|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In October 2017, the [[LIGO]] and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction. This confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817|title=GW170817 Press Release|website=LIGO Lab – Caltech|access-date=24 October 2017|archive-date=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017010137/https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Anomalies and discrepancies==
{{distinguish|Gravity anomaly}}

There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other ways.
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|thumb|Rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). The discrepancy between the curves is attributed to [[dark matter]].]]
* '''Extra-fast stars''': Stars in galaxies follow a [[Galaxy rotation curve|distribution of velocities]] where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according to the observed distributions of normal matter. Galaxies within [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] show a similar pattern. [[Dark matter]], which would interact through gravitation but not electromagnetically, would account for the discrepancy. Various [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|modifications to Newtonian dynamics]] have also been proposed.
* '''[[Flyby anomaly]]''': Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during [[gravity assist]] maneuvers.
* '''[[Accelerated expansion]]''': The [[expansion of the universe]] seems to be speeding up. [[Dark energy]] has been proposed to explain this. A recent alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all,<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/astronomy/cosmology/mg19726461.600-dark-energy-may-just-be-a-cosmic-illusion.html Dark energy may just be a cosmic illusion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813203605/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726461-600-dark-energy-may-just-be-a-cosmic-illusion/?ignored=irrelevant |date=13 August 2021 }}, ''New Scientist'', issue 2646, 7 March 2008.</ref> however this conclusion is disputed.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026783.800-swisscheese-model-of-the-cosmos-is-full-of-holes.html Swiss-cheese model of the cosmos is full of holes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506205749/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026783.800-swisscheese-model-of-the-cosmos-is-full-of-holes.html |date=6 May 2015 }}, ''New Scientist'', issue 2678, 18 October 2008.</ref>
* '''Anomalous increase of the [[astronomical unit]]''': Recent measurements indicate that [[Astronomical unit#Developments|planetary orbits are widening]] faster than if this were solely through the Sun losing mass by radiating energy.
* '''Extra energetic photons''': Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] gain twice as much energy as expected. This may indicate that gravity falls off faster than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.<ref name=newsci2699>{{cite web|last=Chown|first=Marcus|title=Gravity may venture where matter fears to tread|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126990.400-gravity-may-venture-where-matter-fears-to-tread.html|website=New Scientist|access-date=4 August 2013|date=16 March 2009|issue=2699|archive-date=18 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218030542/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126990.400-gravity-may-venture-where-matter-fears-to-tread.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
* '''Extra massive hydrogen clouds''': The spectral lines of the [[Lyman-alpha forest]] suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together at certain scales than expected and, like [[dark flow]], may indicate that gravity falls off slower than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.<ref name=newsci2699/>
