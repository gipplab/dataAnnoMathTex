The interior of the prototype unveiled on November 21, 2019, included a 17-inch center display, seating for 6 using two bench seats with the front middle seat being a fold-down center arm rest, a digital rear-view camera based mirror, a race car style [[Yoke (aeronautics)|steering yoke]], and a [[dashboard]] with a surface resembling marble.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTw1eOpjHi4 |title=Riding in a Tesla Cybertruck is Unlike Any Other Tesla |last=Sullins |first=Ben |access-date=November 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128024045/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTw1eOpjHi4 |archive-date=November 28, 2019 |url-status=live |via=YouTube}}</ref>

=== Bed (vault) ===
[[File:Tesla Cybertruck unveiling.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Rear view, 2019 prototype]]
Preliminary specifications indicate the Cybertruck is planned to be offered with one bed, similar in size to a conventional pickup truck bed, {{convert|6.5|ft}} long. It has a planned integral motorized [[roller shutter]] style [[tonneau]] cover to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle. Tesla terms this {{convert|100|ft3|adj=on}} enclosed space "the vault," because of the additional security the company says it provides.<ref name=tesla20191122 /> The 2019 prototype had vertical internal walls, while pre-production models photographed in 2023 have sloped side walls.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.musclecarsandtrucks.com/tesla-cybertruck-bed-up-close-has-questionable-design/ |title=Tesla Cybertruck bed spotted up close, has questionable design |last=Quinn |first=Zac |date=October 14, 2023 |work=Muscle Cars and Trucks |access-date=8 November 2023}}</ref>

== Safety concerns ==
The Cybertruck's design has received criticism from automotive safety groups, including the [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program]] and the [[Euro NCAP]], for not conforming to standards for pedestrian and cyclist safety. In its December 2019 form, the truck would likely not be [[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]] in either [[Australia]] or the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=Carlton |date=December 16, 2019 |title=Tesla Cybertruck Not Street-Legal In EU |work=Forbes |location=US |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2019/12/16/tesla-cybertruck-not-street-legal-in-eu/ |access-date=June 8, 2021}}</ref> Particular concerns highlighted by these two bodies include the high stiffness of the "exoskeleton" exterior resulting in a lack of [[crumple zone]]s, as well as the tall, flat front of the truck, which could increase the severity of leg injuries.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hagon |first=Toby |date=November 26, 2019 |title=New Tesla Cybertruck could put other road users at risk |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Australia |url=https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/motoring-news/new-tesla-cybertruck-could-put-other-road-users-at-risk/news-story/da648cad43ef731ae5dbb45632a6ed41 |access-date=June 7, 2021}}</ref>
