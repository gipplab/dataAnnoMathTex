The '''many-body problem''' is a general name for a vast category of physical problems pertaining to the properties of microscopic systems made of many interacting particles. ''Microscopic'' here implies that [[quantum mechanics]] has to be used to provide an accurate description of the system. ''Many'' can be anywhere from three to infinity (in the case of a practically infinite, [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or periodic system, such as a [[crystal]]), although three- and four-body systems can be treated by specific means (respectively the [[Faddeev equations|Faddeev]] and Faddeev–Yakubovsky equations) and are thus sometimes separately classified as [[few-body systems]].

In general terms, while the underlying [[physical laws]] that govern the motion of each individual particle may (or may not) be simple, the study of the collection of particles can be extremely complex. In such a quantum system, the repeated interactions between particles create quantum correlations, or entanglement. As a consequence, the [[wave function]] of the system is a complicated object holding a large amount of [[Information theory|information]], which usually makes exact or analytical calculations impractical or even impossible.

This becomes especially clear by a comparison to classical mechanics. Imagine a single particle that can be described with <math>k</math> numbers (take for example a free particle described by its position and velocity vector, resulting in <math>k=6</math>). In classical mechanics, <math>n</math> such particles can simply be described by <math>k\cdot n</math> numbers. The dimension of the classical many-body system scales linearly with the number of particles <math> n </math>.
In quantum mechanics, however, the many-body-system is in general in a superposition of combinations of single particle states - all the <math> k^n </math> different combinations have to be accounted for. The dimension of the quantum many body system therefore scales exponentially with <math> n </math>, much faster than in classical mechanics.

Because the required numerical expense grows so quickly, simulating the dynamics of more than three quantum-mechanical particles is already infeasible for many physical systems.<ref>{{Cite journal

In many cases, [[Emergence|emergent phenomena]] may arise which bear little resemblance to the underlying elementary laws.
