[[file:EM Spectrum Properties edit.svg|thumb|330px|Different lengths as in respect to the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], measured by the metre and its derived scales. The nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale and mostly in the [[Molecule|molecular]] scale.]]
The '''nanometre''' (international spelling as used by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]; [[SI]] symbol: '''nm'''), or '''nanometer''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|American spelling]]), is a [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] in the International System of Units (SI), equal to one [[billionth]] ([[short scale]]) of a [[metre|meter]] (0.000000001&nbsp;m) and to 1000&nbsp;[[picometres]]. One nanometre can be expressed in [[scientific notation]] as 1 × 10<sup>-9</sup>&nbsp;m and as {{sfrac|{{val|1000000000}}}}&nbsp;m.

==History==
The nanometre was formerly known as the "''millimicrometre''"&nbsp;– or, more commonly, the "''millimicron''" for short&nbsp;– since it is {{sfrac|1000}} of a [[micrometre|micrometer]]. It was often denoted by the symbol ''mμ'' or, more rarely, as ''μμ'' (however, ''μμ'' should refer to a ''millionth'' of a micron).<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |first1=The |last1=Svedberg |first2=J.

==Etymology==
The name combines the [[SI prefix]] ''[[nano-]]'' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|νάνος}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|nanos}}'', "dwarf") with the parent unit name ''metre'' (from Greek {{lang|grc|μέτρον}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|metrοn}}'', "unit of measurement").

==Usage==
[[Nanotechnology|Nanotechnologies]] are based on physical processes which occur on a scale of nanometres (see [[nanoscopic scale]]).<ref name=":0" />

The nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale: the diameter of a [[helium]] atom, for example, is about 0.06&nbsp;nm, and that of a [[ribosome]] is about 20&nbsp;nm. The nanometre is also commonly used to specify the [[wavelength]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]: visible light ranges from around 400 to 700&nbsp;nm.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |first=Yasitha L. |last=Hewakuruppu |first2=Leonid A. |last2=Dombrovsky |first3=Chuyang |last3=Chen |first4=Victoria |last4=Timchenko |first5=Xuchuan |last5=Jiang |first6=Sung |last6=Baek |first7=Robert A. |last7=Taylor  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069746 |title=Plasmonic " pump – probe " method to study semi-transparent nanofluids |journal=Applied Optics |date=2013 |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=6041–6050|doi=10.1364/AO.52.006041 |pmid=24085009 |bibcode=2013ApOpt..52.6041H }}</ref> The [[ångström]], which is equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm, was formerly used for these purposes.

Since the late 1980s, in usages such as the [[32 nanometer|32&nbsp;nm]] and the [[22 nanometer|22&nbsp;nm]] [[semiconductor node]], it has also been used to describe typical feature sizes in successive generations of the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS Roadmap]] for miniaturized [[semiconductor device fabrication]] in the [[semiconductor industry]].
